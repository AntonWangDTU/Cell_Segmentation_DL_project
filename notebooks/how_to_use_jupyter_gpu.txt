You should start jupyter notebook on the GPU nodes as follow

jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=ABCD --ip=$HOSTNAME


Choose for ABCD a free port. Or leave out the "--port" and let jupyter find a free por for you.
In the terminal you will see a line like
"    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://n-62-20-1:8888/tree?token=db17ed975a296c04cf07392d2325e3e6c18d483cb3e4b497"
this shows the HOSTNAME (n-62-20-1) and the port 8888


On your machine, open a tunnel one login node, preferably nilogin

ssh -N -L ABCD:HOSTNAME:ABCD s183220@nilogin.gbar.dtu.dk

where HOSTNAME and ABCD are the one printed in the terminal on the cluster. The tunnel will remain open until you close it.
